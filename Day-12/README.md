##Authentication


Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is who or what they say they are. Authentication technology provides access control for systems
by checking to see if a user's credentials match the credentials in a database of authorized users or a data authentication server.




##Authorization 


Authorization is the process of giving someone the ability to access a resource. Of course, this definition may sound obscure, but many situations in real life can help
illustrate what authorization means so that you can apply those concepts to computer systems. A good example is house ownership.
